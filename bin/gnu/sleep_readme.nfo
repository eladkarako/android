Usage: sleep.exe NUMBER[SUFFIX]...
  or:  sleep.exe OPTION
Pause for NUMBER seconds.  SUFFIX may be `s' for seconds (the default),
`m' for minutes, `h' for hours or `d' for days.  Unlike most implementations
that require NUMBER be an integer, here NUMBER may be an arbitrary floating
point number.
