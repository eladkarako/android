the url:  
https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip

will redirect to the latest url,  
for example:  
https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r33.0.2-windows.zip

open the zip, enter the first folder (`platform-tools`), drag files into this folder, overwriting existing ones.

<hr/>

you can also work manually similar to downloading the build-tools  
(build tools url does not seem to have a "-latest-" shortcut like platform-tools to redirect you, for some reason),  
get https://dl.google.com/android/repository/repository2-1.xml  
look for platform-tools_  
and -windows  
get the most recent one, append it to https://dl.google.com/android/repository/ to get a download link.
