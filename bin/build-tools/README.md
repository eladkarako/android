download:  
https://dl.google.com/android/repository/repository2-1.xml

look for the string:  
build-tools

the first result is the latest. continue searching until you reach something with:  
-windows

add the `url`-tag textual-content (for example `<url>build-tools_r33-windows.zip</url>`), to:  
https://dl.google.com/android/repository/

and that is the download url. for example:  
https://dl.google.com/android/repository/build-tools_r33-windows.zip

after download, enter the first folder (for example: `android-Tiramisu`),  
drag the files into this folder, overwrite existing files.
